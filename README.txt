# Salesforce Prediction Model

## Project Overview

This project aims to assist a Salesforce team within a bank in identifying customers with the highest propensity to sign up for a Point of Sale (POS) system. Given theie limited capacity it's critical to prioritize customer interactions to maximize the number of successful POS sign-ups

## Data Description

This project utilizes a provided dataset containing anonymized and sanitized data from SMEs. This dataset includes information on various SMEs, some of which signed up for a POS within three months after the original data collection point. The primary goal is to build a predictive model to identify potential customers for targeted sales efforts.

## Model Development

The predictive model was developed following these steps:
1. **Data Preparation:** Cleaning and preprocessing the data to optimize the model's performance.
2. **Model Building:** Using machine learning techniques to create a propensity model predicting whether a customer is likely to sign up for a POS.
3. **Evaluation:** Assessing the model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results

The model's performance is detailed in the notebook, highlighting its predictive capabilities and potential areas for improvement. These results guide the CRM and sales teams in focusing their efforts on the most promising leads.
